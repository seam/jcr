   <title>Seam JCR - Event Mapping</title>
   <section id="jcr-event-mapping-intro">
   <para>
      Seam JCR provides functionality to fire CDI Events based on events found in JCR.  The rules of how events are
      fired are based around the underlying implementation.
   </para>
   <tip>
       You will not have an active JCR Session during the event firing,
      a new one will need to be created.

   <para>
        To observe an event, use the @Observes and the additional qualifiers on 
        seam-api module (Check package org.jboss.seam.jcr.annotations.events).

        If you need to watch any JCR event, then avoid using any Qualifier at
        all.
