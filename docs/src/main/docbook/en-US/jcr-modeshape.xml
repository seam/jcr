        <para> In order to activate ModeShape support within your application, you need to include
            ModeShape on your classpath. At a minimum, the following maven dependencies must be
            satisfied. </para>

        <tip>
            <para> Substitute ${modeshape.version} for the ModeShape version you are running
                against. Currently, Seam JCR tests against 2.5.0.Final. In addition, Lucene is
                required to run ModeShape. Please consult the ModeShape getting stated guide for
                exact versions. </para>

        <para> In order to use ModeShape's Repository and Session objects in your application, you
            must define an injection point using the JcrConfiguration annotation based on
            ModeShape's required configuration parameters. Please review the ModeShape getting
            started guide for further details. </para>
