        <title>ModeShape Integration Installation</title>
        <para> In order to activate ModeShape support within your application, you need to include
            ModeShape on your classpath. At a minimum, the following maven dependencies must be
            satisfied. </para>

        <tip>
            <para> Substitute ${modeshape.version} for the ModeShape version you are running
                against. Currently, Seam JCR tests against 2.5.0.Final. In addition, Lucene is
                required to run ModeShape. Please consult the <ulink url="http://docs.jboss.org/modeshape/latest/manuals/gettingstarted/html/">ModeShape Getting Started Guide</ulink> 
                for exact versions. </para>

        <title>Usage</title>
        <para> In order to use ModeShape's Repository and Session objects in your application, you
            must define an injection point using the JcrConfiguration annotation based on
            ModeShape's required configuration parameters. Please review the 
            <ulink url="http://docs.jboss.org/modeshape/latest/manuals/gettingstarted/html/">ModeShape Getting Started Guide</ulink>
            for further details. </para>
