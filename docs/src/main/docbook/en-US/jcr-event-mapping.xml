	<title>Seam JCR - Event Mapping</title>
	<section id="jcr-event-mapping-intro">
		<para> Seam JCR provides functionality to fire CDI Events based on events found in JCR. The
			rules of how events are fired are based around the underlying implementation. </para>
		<tip> You will not have an active JCR Session during the event firing, a new one will need
			to be created. </tip>
		<tip> Some JCR implementations, like Modeshape fires events on a separate thread, so
			probably you will get errors if your observer method is declared on a @RequestScoped
			object, for example. </tip>
	</section>
	<section id="jcr-event-mapping-activation">
		<para> To observe an event, use the @Observes and the additional qualifiers on seam-jcr-api
			module (Check package org.jboss.seam.jcr.annotations.events). If you need to watch any
			JCR event, then avoid using any Qualifier at all. </para>
