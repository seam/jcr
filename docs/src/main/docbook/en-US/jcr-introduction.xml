      The Seam JCR Module aims to simplify the integration points between JCR
      implementations and CDI applications.
        </para>

        <para>
       The Seam JCR module is compatible with JCR 2.0 implementations.  It strictly compiles against JCR 2.0.  However,
       test cases are executed against both ModeShape and JackRabbit to ensure compatibility.

        <para>
	   	If you are using
            <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</ulink> as your build tool, you can add the
	   	following single dependency to your pom.xml file to include Seam JCR:
        </para>
        <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<dependency>
   <groupId>org.jboss.seam.jcr</groupId>
   <artifactId>seam-jcr</artifactId>
   <version>${seam.jcr.version}</version>
</dependency>]]>
        </programlisting>
        <tip>
            <para>
            Substitute the expression ${seam.jcr.version} with the most recent or appropriate version of Seam JCR.
            Alternatively, you can create a
                <ulink
            href="http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnref-book/reference/resource-filtering-sect-properties.html#resource-filtering-sect-user-defined">Maven
            user-defined property
                </ulink> to satisfy this substitution so you can centrally manage the version.
            </para>
        </tip>
        <para>
         Alternatively, you can use the API at compile time and only include the implementation at runtime. This protects
         you from inadvertantly depending on an implementation class.
        </para>
        <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<dependency>
   <groupId>org.jboss.seam.jcr</groupId>
   <artifactId>seam-jcr-api</artifactId>
   <version>${seam.jcr.version}</version>
   <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>

<dependency>
   <groupId>org.jboss.seam.jcr</groupId>
   <artifactId>seam-jcr</artifactId>
   <version>${seam.jcr.version}</version>
   <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>]]>
        </programlisting>
    </section>
    <para>
      In addition to your Seam JCR dependencies, you must also declare a dependency on a JCR Implementation.
    </para>
