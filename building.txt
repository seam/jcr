Building this project
=====================

This project requires Apache Maven (available from http://maven.apache.org/) 
Version 3.0.3 or later to build. It also requires that the JBoss Public Maven
Repository is configured - this can be done in one of two ways:

1) Configure your settings.xml (usually found in the .m2 directory within your
home directory) to include the JBoss repository - see the instructions on the 
following page to learn how to do this: http://community.jboss.org/wiki/MavenGettingStarted

2) Use the provided settings.xml, by running "mvn <target> -s settings.xml".
